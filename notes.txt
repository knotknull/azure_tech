## Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars
##
5 Pillars
 - Cost Optimization
 - Operational excellence
 - Performance efficiency
 - Reliability
 - Security

# Cost Optimization: ^-Quality ^-Speed  ^-Efficiency   v-Cost

# Operational Excellence
  - modern dev practices for faster development / automation

# Performance efficiency
  - adjust resources for performance and scalability

# Reliability
  - anticipate failures in design

# Security
  - secure data via authentication / encryption

## Cost Optimization
##

 - Plan and estiamate costs
    - requirements need to be identified

 - Provision w/ optimization
    - Move from IaaS to PaaS where possible

 - Monitoring and analytics for cost insights

 - Maximize efficiency of cloud spend
    - reduce idle resources
    - paying twice for licenses, etc.
    - manually / dynamically adjust resourcing


## Operational Excellence
##
  - full visibility into how app is running
  - dev and release practices agile
        - Infra as code
        - automate testing / build
  - culture of sharing, collaboration and transparency
  - use monitoring analytics to gain op insights
        - monitoring, logging and instrumentation
  - automate to reduce effort and error


## Performance Efficiency
##
 - matching resources that are available w/ demand it is receiving
  - scale up
  - scale out
  - autoscaling
  - optimize network performance (add messaging layer)
  - optimize storage performance  (partitioning / caching)

## Deploying a Virtual Machine in  great solutions with the Microsoft Azure

## Rightsize Virtual Machines
##

  - Azure Compute Unit (ACU)
    100 = Small (Standard A1) VM
      A = Family
      1 = Size (versioned)
      DS_V3 = 160 - 190 ACU

## Compute sizes
##

General Purpose : Balanced CPU to memory ratio (test / dev, small-med db, low-med web)
 - B, Dsv3, Dv3, DSv2, Dv2, DS, D, Av2, A0-7

Compute Optimized: High CPU to memory ratio (med web, app server, batch process )
 - Fsv2, Fs, F

Memory Optimized: High memory to  CPU ratio (relational db, med - large cache, in-mem analytics )
 - Esv3, Ev3, M, GS, G, DSv2, DS, Dv2, D

Storage Optimized: High disk throuput and IS (Big Data, SQL, NoSQL )
 - Ls

GPU : Specialized for graphics rendeing, deep learning
 - NV, NC, NCv2, NCv3, ND

High performance compute : Fastest most powerful CPU, high throughput Netrwork (RDMA)
 - H, A8-11


## Standard vs. Premium Disks
##
      Standard                              Premium
- backed by HDDs                      - Backed by high-speed SSD
- Stored in Azure Account             - IOPS values are predictable,
- Std SSD (preview) available in        expected performance levels
  managed disks (dev/test/            - Prepay for all storage used
          entry level prod)               (fixed disk sizes)
- Std Storage provides maximum              P10, 128 GB, 500 IOPS, 50 MB/s
  IOPS values for each VHD (virt HDD)
[ Generation 1.VHD ]

## Managed vs. Unmanaged Disks
##
      UnManaged                              Managed
- Original method store VM VHDs             - Azure manages disks, don't have to
- VHDs stored as page blobs in                worry about storage account or IOPS restrictions
  Azure storage account                     - Pre-pay for disk size (no need for stog acct)
- Max 256 TB *** storage per VM                 S10, 128 GB, 500 IOS, 60MB/S
- Need to manage storage account            - Supports Std / Prem SSD and Std HDD
  availability                              - Easier to create snapshots / disk images
- 20,000 IOPS limit across all VM disks
  in a standard storag acct

# Sizes for virtual Machines

# Azure VM Chooser

Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer
  - software for storage accounts / un-managed disks


## Designing Virtual Network Environment
##

Network Resource Provider

- Virtual Network
    -  All VMs withing vnet can communicate with each other
    -  VMs in separate vnets cannot communicate by default

- Address Space / subnet (IPv4 range)
    - subnet of VNet

- Virtual Network Interface Card
  IP address bound to VNIC and not the VM
    - VNIC can have private IP from VNet and possible public IP

Powershell >> az interactive (Azure CLI v2)  / cross platform python app
NOTE: also available under bash!!

NOTE: to change settings (i.e. JSON output) type: az configure

> az network vnet create ....


## Plan for VM High Availability
##
2 ways for high availability

 [ Availability Set ]         [ Availability Zone ]

Availability Set:
  - Server level fault tolerance within a single data center in an Azure Region
Fault Domain (Server Rack)
  - assign multiple nodes of app (i.e. web servers) to same Availability Set
  - Azure will assign them do different Fault Domains (racks)

Update Domain:
  - deploy separate VMS on separate hardware hosts

- 99.95% availability SLA with availability sets   ***
  NOTE: Must assign availability set at VM deployment

- 99.9% availability single-instance SLA with premium storage ***



Availability Zone:
- place redundant VMs in separate data centers (within same region)
  NOTE: Not every region has multiple Availability Zones
